# Breast Cancer Classification with Tree-Based Models

This project applies several state-of-the-art tree-based machine learning models to classify breast cancer using a real-world dataset.

## Models Trained

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Data cleaned and preprocessed (label encoding, feature selection)
    - Train/test split with stratification

2. **Model Training**
    - All models trained on the same training data
    - Consistent random state for reproducibility

3. **Model Evaluation**
    - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
    - Classification reports and confusion matrices for each model
    - Results presented in a comparison table

4. **Feature Importance**
    - Visualized top features for Random Forest (and available in other models)
    - Code designed for extensibility to other tree-based models




- Random Forest and gradient boosting models demonstrated the highest performance on most metrics.
- Feature importance visualization highlighted the top diagnostic predictors.
